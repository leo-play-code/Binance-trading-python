# Python-ImageSearch

it's a wrapper around pyautogui and opencv2, to allow you to easily add cross-platform image searching capabilities
to your project.

See the documentation for examples. If you have any questions feel free to contact me.

Documentation : https://brokencode.io/how-to-easily-image-search-with-python/

This is the currently maintained package, so if you've come from
https://pypi.org/project/python-imagesearch-drov0/
or
https://pypi.org/project/python-imageseach-drov0/

you are at the right place

## Easy Example:

## Install:

> pip install python-imagesearch

You may need to install dependencies depending on your OS:

### Linux :
```

sudo apt-get install scrot python3-tk python3-dev python3-opencv
```
### Windows :

No setup should be needed 

### MacOs : 
```
brew install opencv
pip3 install -U pyobjc-core
pip3 install -U pyobjc
```
I have not tested myself as I don't own a mac, but it was tested and documented in this issue : https://github.com/drov0/python-imagesearch/issues/5
